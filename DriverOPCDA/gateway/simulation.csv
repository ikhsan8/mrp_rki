# OPC Server - Alias CSV File
# Format as follows:
# GroupName,AliasName,ItemPath,DataType,ReadOnly,PollAlways,UpdateRate,ScalingType,ScalingOption1,ScalingOption2,ScalingOption3,ScalingOption4,ScalingOption5,RegisterInitialValue,EventEnabled,EventSource,EventCategory,EventSeverity,EventMessage,TriggerType,TimestampType
# 
# For example:
# MyGroup1,MyAlias1,Plc1.4:1001,3,1,1,500
# MyGroup1,MyAlias2,Plc1.5:1001,2,0,0,1000,1,100,0,100,0,2,,1,Alias,10000,1,Event Message,0,0
# MyGroup2,MyAlias3,,2,0,0,0,0,,,,,,5
# 
# Tips:
#      - Do not leave spaces between commas and values
#      - All fields up to and including UpdateRate are mandatory
#      - Consult the user's manual for valid data type enumerations
#      - Always provide an update rate when PollAlways is 1
#      - Aliases are case sensitive; ensure you use appropriate case
#      - Each scaling type has its own required options (see below)
#      - When an alias has events enabled (EventEnabled is 1):
#           - A source and category must be provided
#           - The import will fail if its event category does not exist
#           - Event categories must be defined before importing the CSV file
# 
# ScalingType:
#      0 - none
#      1 - linear
#      2 - square root
#      3 - gain/offset
#      4 - expression
#      5 - calculation
# 
# Linear:
#      ScalingOption1: High Raw
#      ScalingOption2: Low Raw
#      ScalingOption3: High Scaled
#      ScalingOption4: Low Scaled
#      ScalingOption5: High/Low Clamp (0 -> both disabled; 1 -> low enabled; 2 -> high enabled; 3 -> both enabled)
# 
# Square root:
#      ScalingOption1: High Raw
#      ScalingOption2: Low Raw
#      ScalingOption3: High Scaled
#      ScalingOption4: Low Scaled
#      ScalingOption5: High/Low Clamp (0 -> both disabled; 1 -> low enabled; 2 -> high enabled; 3 -> both enabled)
# 
# Gain/offset:
#      ScalingOption1: Gain
#      ScalingOption2: Offset
# 
# Expression
#      ScalingOption1: Input
#      ScalingOption2: Output
# 
# Calculation
#      ScalingOption1: Calculation
